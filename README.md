Quick Start
===========

Install ZSH and OH-MY-ZSH (make sure to switch your default shell to ZSH using
`chsh -s /bin/zsh`).

..and then..

**Warning:** installation process may remove some of your files. Only install this
software at your own risk.

``` html
curl -L https://github.com/ordabool/dotfiles/raw/master/tools/install.sh | sh
```

or

``` html
wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/ordabool/dotfiles/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh
```

Installation script installs only dotfiles for the components that are installed on
your system. Here is the full list of components:

* ZSH
* OH-MY-ZSH
* VIM
* GIT
* SCREEN
* TMUX
* [rainbarf for TMUX](https://github.com/creaktive/rainbarf)

`Git` configuration file is copied and not symlinked upon installation
because your name and email should be hardcoded there without changing
the dotfiles repo. So after pulling in new commits related to git
configuration I do `sh ~/.dotfiles/tools/setup.sh` which syncs
everything, including bringing in new git configuration file.

Screenshots
===========

Below are some screenshots of how your environment should look after setting
up the dotfiles. Make sure to apply Solarized theme to your terminal in order
to get similar effect.

ZSH + GIT
